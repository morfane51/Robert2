        will be able to consult the events of your calendar, without being connected to the
        application! So be sure to only share this link with people you trust.\n\n
        To use this link, go to your compatible calendar application, and look for the
        \"New Calendar Subscription\" feature. Please note that the refresh rate in these
        applications is highly variable, so they may display event changes with a delay."
